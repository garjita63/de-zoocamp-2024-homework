I have just finished doing hands-on learning and HW4 (Analytics Engineering - DTC DE Zoomcamp Week 4) contains: Intro to Analytics Engineering & dbt,  setting up dbt (Cloud, Core - Docker & non-Docker), developing with dbt, building and documenting dbt models, deployment of a dbt project, and visulization (Looker Studio).
